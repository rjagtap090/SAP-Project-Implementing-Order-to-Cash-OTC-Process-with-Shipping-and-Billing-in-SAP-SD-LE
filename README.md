# SAP-Project-Implementing-Order-to-Cash-OTC-Process-with-Shipping-and-Billing-in-SAP-SD-LE

Project Overview:
In this project, we will implement the Order-to-Cash (OTC) process in SAP using the Sales and Distribution (SD) and Logistics Execution (LE) modules. The project will cover the entire sales cycle, including order creation, shipping, and billing. The aim is to automate and streamline the flow of sales from customer order receipt to the final invoicing stage.

Project Scope:

1.Customer Master Data Setup: Creating customer accounts in SAP.

2.Material Master Data Setup: Setting up materials/products in SAP.

3.Sales Order Creation: Entering sales orders from customers.

4.Delivery Creation and Goods Movement: Creating outbound deliveries and recording goods movement.

5.Billing/Invoicing: Generating invoices for customers after successful delivery.

Steps:
1. Customer Master Data Setup
Transaction Code: XD01
Here, we create a customer in the system. You need to define the customerâ€™s sales area, billing information, shipping details, and more.

bash
Copy code
XD01 - Create Customer (Complete)
2. Material Master Data Setup
Transaction Code: MM01
You need to create materials that will be sold to the customer. This involves setting up the material description, sales information, and relevant pricing details.

bash
Copy code
MM01 - Create Material
3. Sales Order Creation
Transaction Code: VA01
Once customers and materials are set up, the next step is creating a sales order. This includes selecting the customer, the material being ordered, the quantity, and the pricing details.

bash
Copy code
VA01 - Create Sales Order
Key SAP Tables Involved:

VBAK: Sales Document Header
VBAP: Sales Document Item
4. Delivery Creation and Goods Movement
Transaction Code: VL01N
After creating the sales order, the next step is to process the outbound delivery. Here, the goods are picked, packed, and shipped to the customer.

bash
Copy code
VL01N - Create Outbound Delivery
Goods Movement: Once the delivery is processed, you record the movement of goods from your inventory to the customer. Transaction Code: VL02N

bash
Copy code
VL02N - Post Goods Issue
Key SAP Tables Involved:

LIKP: Delivery Header Data
LIPS: Delivery Item Data
5. Billing/Invoicing
Transaction Code: VF01
The final step in the OTC process is to create an invoice for the customer. This is done after the goods are delivered.

bash
Copy code
VF01 - Create Billing Document
Key SAP Tables Involved:

VBRK: Billing Document Header
VBRP: Billing Document Item
Full SAP Code Example for Sales Order to Billing:
Here is an example of ABAP code to retrieve sales order, delivery, and billing data.

ABAP
Copy code
REPORT z_otc_process.

TABLES: vbak, vbap, likp, lips, vbrk, vbrp.

PARAMETERS: p_vbeln TYPE vbeln.

START-OF-SELECTION.

* Retrieve Sales Order Data
SELECT * FROM vbak INTO TABLE lt_vbak WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.
SELECT * FROM vbap INTO TABLE lt_vbap WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.

* Retrieve Delivery Data
SELECT * FROM likp INTO TABLE lt_likp WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.
SELECT * FROM lips INTO TABLE lt_lips WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.

* Retrieve Billing Data
SELECT * FROM vbrk INTO TABLE lt_vbrk WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.
SELECT * FROM vbrp INTO TABLE lt_vbrp WHERE vbeln = p_vbeln.

* Display the Results
LOOP AT lt_vbak INTO wa_vbak.
  WRITE: / 'Sales Order:', wa_vbak-vbeln, wa_vbak-erdat.
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT lt_likp INTO wa_likp.
  WRITE: / 'Delivery:', wa_likp-vbeln, wa_likp-erdat.
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT lt_vbrk INTO wa_vbrk.
  WRITE: / 'Billing Document:', wa_vbrk-vbeln, wa_vbrk-erdat.
ENDLOOP.
This ABAP code can be used to fetch and display data for sales orders, deliveries, and billing documents.
